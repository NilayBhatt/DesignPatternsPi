# Group 04 Final Project üçÄ

This project enables a Raspberry Pi to take photos throughout the day and at the end of the day create a .gif file of all the timelapse photos and tweet it to a user's account. Depending on what sensers are attached to the Pi at the time a photo is taken, the Pi will behave differently. For example, if a temperature sensor is attahced to the Pi, it will be determined if the temperature is hot or cold and accordingly a Blue or Red hue will be added after a photo is taken.
